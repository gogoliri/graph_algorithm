Hi, sorry for the ugly format of the output
Please put the files together to run:
    -main.py
    -graafi3.py
    -an edge list of your choice
Run the file main.py
Change the *filename* variable in main.py to choose graph of your choice
I tried to name variable self-explanatory
Don't replaced graafi3.py with any other version
This file (graafi3.py) has been modified to remove edge from graph
In the output, I add an extra step to calculate weight of MST
Since my code does not return the same MST with the test results of the teacher
Using weight of MST (w_mst) is the only weight to check the validity of the MST
    # G1 w_mst = 26
    # G2 w_mst = 9
    # G3 w_mst = 6
    # G4 w_mst = 17
for the convenience, my DFS always start at vertex 1, you can change it
Good luck
